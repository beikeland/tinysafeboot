# Experimental Developments


## What is this

As we experiment with different techniques and improvements, we sometimes choose to branch the repository.

However branching provides low visibility on experiments and is often useful for other purposes such as the development of a new version (when we know in which direction we're headed)

We'd like to make these experiments visible and hopefuly many of them will be incorporate dinto development; others that don't are still useful resources for anyone working or reasearching this topic.


## What experiments are here?

We separate each experiment into it's own subfolder. Therefore, dig into the subfolders and check the README files there.
